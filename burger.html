        <h1 id="top">Mike's burger blog</h1>
        <p id="opener">So this was a little fun side part of our trip through the American Southwest. We tried several burger joints and I'll attempt
        to rank them based on feedback from four different perspectives. Do note, all but one was a franchise so experiences likely vary in 
        other places than the ones we visited.</p><br>
        <h3>White Castle</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/8493236_web1_whitecastlesign.jpg" width="25%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 3 Stars - Nice snack like food, but lacks depth and the real sense of eating a burger. Tasty just lacking pizzaz.</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: 2.5 Stars - The size was cute. Liked how the buns were soggy from grease/steam. Besides that nothing special, but 
            definitely better than the frozen ones.</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 1 Star - Bland patties</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 3 Stars - Nice tiny burgers, but with little flavor and very overpriced. Good ice cream.</p>
        <p>Summary: All agreed that our first stop was the lowest scoring. I secretly hoped this pop culture icon would prove to be the stuff
            movies are written about, but ultimately it's just a niche neighborhood joint.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Black Tap</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJLDoMvwYbZlg8NPOWiTSFXC_JI=/0x0:1000x1083/1200x800/filters:focal(438x205:598x365)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57158833/Black_Tap_Craft_Burger___Beer.0.jpg" width="25%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 3.25 - Stars I had high hopes for this spot considering the price and advertising, but it was more gimmicky than quality. The 
            burger was good, just not that good.</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: 2.5 Stars - Got the truffle burger, but the truffle flavor didn't stand out. It was a bit overcooked and tough for 
            wagyu beef.</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 2.5 Stars - Bison patty was overcooked.</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 4.5 Stars - Amazing tasting turkey burger. Added extra toppings like eggs and mushrooms so it got a bit messy.
            decent shakes with good decor.</p>
        <p>Summary: With Joey being the exception we were a bit underwhelmed. After going there and talking to the waiter, it seems the shakes
            are really the main attraction and perhaps the burgers are an afterthought. Or it could be Joey is the only one who knows how to order
            his meal right.</p>
        <br>

            <br></div>
        <h3>Wendy's</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/story/wendys-makes-changes-improve-quality-beef-supply-chain.jpg?itok=zVHWlnWR" width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 3.5 Stars, obviously this wasn't my first time here so I had no surprises. Always a good reliable burger choice.</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: I ate a salad...</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 2.5 Stars - Standard fast food.</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 3.25 Stars - Just a plain ol' Wendy's burger.</p>
        <p>Summary: This is a standard spot and one we generally prefer in our home town, often over other national chains. We needed a 
            spot at a stopping point and we can all agree on going here. Figured it would also make a good baseline for comparison.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Whataburger</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/B7JNM21kwGupsvnmtyZ1I3ZxW7U=/800x518/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RNUAU5CWRRGC7K7GGONYDTJFX4.jpg" width="25%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 4.25 - Stars I had to say wow on this one. I wasn't expecting much but it was a really good burger, 
            incredible patty texture and taste. Please bring one to Washington!</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: 2.5 Stars - I had the patty melt, it was ok, nothing that made my tastebuds go crazy.</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 3.5 Stars - Has better flavor than most fast food burgers.</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 4.25 Stars - Very good tasting burgers. I would eat these weekly if I had the chance.</p>
        <p>Summary: Aside from Lisa's patty melt this place lived up to the hype that we've heard from word of mouth. Anthony and Joey
            both agreed they want one in Washington now. Anthony ended up getting one more burger for good measure before we left Arizona.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Johnny Rockets</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://edw193gmi952caoiy3mkr4d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JohnnyRockets.jpg" width="25%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 4.5 - Stars Again, my expectations were exceeded. Best lean fat ratio creating wonderful texture, flavor, 
            and richness. Best burger of the trip.</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: 4 Stars - I had a salad, but stole a bite from Mike's sandwich. It eas delicious, juicy, and had lots of good 
            flavor in that one bite!</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 4.5 Stars - Tasty and juicy patty</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 4 Stars - Good burgers and fries with a nice selection to pick from.</p>
        <p>Summary: This one came out of nowhere. We had stopped to observe Montezuma's Castle, and were thinking about lunch. There was a Casino here 
            which seemed out of place, but had a Johnny Rockets inside. Never having eaten at one, I didn't know what to expect. It's a 50's style diner
            so at first felt cliche, but after one bite I forgot about everything else and just enjoyed a really good burger.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>In N Out</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_560049208-800x450.jpg" width="28%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 4 Stars - The double double didn't let me down, but this is the smallest patty, except the sliders from White Castle, 
            need at least a double. Knowing the secret menue helps you make the sandwich you love.</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: 3 Stars - Ordered it animal style which gives it a better flavor. I really enjoyed the freshness, but it didn't wow me.</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 2 Stars</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 4 Stars - As a price point it was a good price for a decent tasting burger.</p>
        <p>Summary: In n Out is typically a good joint, but what it's problem is how busy they always are. Unless you already understand the secret
            menu you may not enjoy the experince as much. The regular menu is wonderfully simple, but when compelled to order quickly to move the line
            along, familiarize yourself first and know the patties are small so ordering 3 or 4 patties(they'll do plenty more) is not a bad idea.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <br></div>
        <h3>Five Guys</h3>
        <div class="box"><img class="photo" src="https://thumbor.thedailymeal.com/xVy4Ii4sEVOZXZQkPTMozGmqgjk=/870x565/https://www.thedailymeal.com/sites/default/files/story/Main-13-five%20guys-shutterstock_240304903.jpg" width="25%">
        <br>
        <p>Mike's rating: 4 - Stars The cheeseburger done your way always makes a tasty experince. The customizable options are both empowering and 
           makes for a good burger. Perhaps a bit complicated, but worth it.</p>
        <p>Lisa's rating: 3.5 Stars - I like the build it my way option, and the buns are better than others. The patty seemed overcooked and drier than previous visits.</p>
        <p>Anthony's rating: 4 Stars - Fresh ingredients.</p>
        <p>Joseph's rating: 4.25 Stars - Best fries on the trip with a great tasting customized burger and a decent shake.</p>
        <p>Summary: Five Guys is never a bad choice. There is a secret complexity hidden under the simple demeanor. Everything is meant to look
            and feel simple and easy while providing you exactly the burger you want. Also large fries is enough for 4 people. They just throw 
            potatoes at you, in a bag of course.</p>
