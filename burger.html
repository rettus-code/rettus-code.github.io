        <p id="opener">So this was a little fun side part of our trip through the American Southwest. We tried several burger joints and I'll attempt
        to rank them based on feedback from four different perspectives. Do note, all but one was a franchise so experiences likely varyin 
        other places than the ones we visited.</p><br>
        <h3>White Castle</h3>

        <p>Mike's rating: 3 Stars Nice snack like food, but lacks depth and the real sense of eating a burger. Tasty just lacking pizzaz.</p>

        <p>Mike's rating: 3.25 Stars I had high hopes for this spot considering the price, but it was more gimmicky than quality. The 
            burger was good, just not that good.</p>

        <p>Mike's rating: 4.25 Stars I had to say wow on this one. I wasn't expecting much but it was a really good burger, 
            incredible patty texture and taste. Please bring one to Washington!</p>

        <p>Mike's rating: 4.5 Stars Again, my expectations were exceeded. Best lean fat ratio creating wonderful texture, flavor, 
            and richness. Best burger of the trip.</p>

        <p>Mike's rating: 4 Stars The double double didn't let me down, but this is the smallest patty, except the sliders from White Castle, 
            need at least a double. Knowing the secret menue helps you make the sandwich you love.</p>

        <p>Mike's rating: 4 Stars The cheeseburger done your way always makes a tasty experince. The customizable options are both empowering and 
           makes for a good burger. Perhaps a bit complicated, but worth it.</p>
