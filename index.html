        <p>So this is my first blog post ever. I have considered doing one before but I suppose I needed a project like this 
            to encourage me. I'm 42 years old and retired from the Navy last year. I decided to take a daring leap and earn 
            a degree in Computer Science and become a web developer. There were many reasons I chose this path, freedom to 
            work from anywhere, I always wanted to go to college, and I'll technically be a scientist. How cool is that!
        </p>
        <p>I knew there would be significant challenges doing this. I have a family I have to take care of, so working going 
            to school full time, and being available for my family leaves me little downtime. My Summers off I play catch up 
            with things that need to be done around the house. That's not to say I don't have somethings working in my favor. 
            Support from my family, a developed work ethic, and an enthusiasm for what I'm learning. It's been a challenge so 
            far, but I love it.</p>
        <p>Thats what brought me here to Khan Academy. I found the calculus courses to help me with my studies. I need a 3.75 
            GPA to be accepted into UW's program so any study material is a benefit. I still have 2 more quarters of calculus 
            to go, plus physics so I'll probably be on here quite a bit in the future. Right now I have the summer off, and 
            complete 2 quarters in Java. I wanted to continue my training with programming but wont see another class on it for 
            another year. So I'm using the Summer to learn the course here since it's right in line with my goal of web 
            development. I'd really like to start creating websites once I finish this Summer, mostly for practice and to 
            develop a portfolio of work before I complete school.</p></div>

        <p>This original bit of work was part of a project on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>
        that seemed perfect for me to migrate here as I explore constructing my own web page as a blog. Eventually I'll likely 
        migrate it again onto an actual blog site, but this will allow mw to continue practicing HTML and CSS. Maybe I'll eventually 
        get to explore JavaScript or put the classes I took in Java to good use we'll just have to see. It's not much to look at now
        though I'm sure that will begin to change quickly as I expand my skillset. For anyone reading this out there and you have
        some good tips for me, I look forward to whatever you have to offer.</p>
